## Setup
The setup was easy. Click, click, click, and done.

## CMS
I have two options to write my blogs: rich text or markdown.

#### Rich Text
This is for non-programmer.

#### Markdown
As a programmer, I prefer to write my blogs this way.

## Features
I can add tags to my blogs!!! This is what I need. Honestly, I didn't expect this.
